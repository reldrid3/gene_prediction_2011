# Gene Prediction Algorithm

## Ross Eldridge, Department of Systems Biology, George Mason University, 2011

### Overview

This final project for Biological Sequence Analysis 730 was to use a neural network to attempt to predict possible open reading frames for prokaryotic genes in a given FASTA sequence.  More detailed information on the structure, function, and analysis of the program can be found in the .doc file associated with the final project.

Currently designed for Python 2.x

syntax: gp.py [test sequence FASTA file] [training sequence FASTA file]

### Files

gp.py - main code, written in Python 2.x, no outside dependencies

EcoliO157.txt - sample FASTA sequence, available from	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AE005174

EcoliO157nh.txt - a second sample FASTA sequence for training, available from	http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/218354981
